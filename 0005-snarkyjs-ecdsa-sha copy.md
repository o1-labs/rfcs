Exposing ECDSA and SHA3/Keccak to SnarkyJS

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

Foreign cryptography primitives such as ECDSA and SHA3/Keccak are widely used outside of Mina. For example, Ethereum uses ECDSA over secp256k1 for signatures - in order to "communicate" with the outside world and other blockchains, SnarkyJS (and therefor Mina) needs to support these primitives as well.
