Older Style RFCs
================

This folder contains archive RFCs that were originally written directly in the mina book before the creation of this separate repository.

Please do not directly modify these RFCs as they are considered to be permanently archived. If you would like to edit the content that they describe for the sake of clarity, create a PR to the mina book --- older RFCs were integrated as sections in the mina book with additional improvements to be more descriptive and readable.
